# The Solution

For solving this problem we need to use tabulation and dp. `dp[i][j]` determines whether we can create the `i+j-1` first characters of `s3` with the first `i` characters of `s1` and `j` characters of `s2`.
Although the current solution seems to have a problem with the test cases that have been hardcoded. I need to solve the issue later.
